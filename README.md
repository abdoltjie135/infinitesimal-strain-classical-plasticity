# Inifinitesimal strain classical plasticity model (Von-Mises & Tresca)
Built in deal.ii. Capable of simulating the Von-Mises and Tresca yield criteria with linear isotropic hardening or perfect plasticity. The small strain assumption was made.

The algorithms and theoretical background can be found in Computational Methods for Plasticity: Theory and Applications.
